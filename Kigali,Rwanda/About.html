                In colonial and pre-genocide Rwanda, Butare was the country's principal centre for tertiary education. Early colleges such as the Nyakibanda Major Seminary, founded in 1936, and three 1960s establishments including the National University of Rwanda (UNR), were all located in the southern city.[183][184][185] The first higher-education institution in Kigali was the Institut Africain et Mauricien de statistique et d'économie appliquée, which was founded in 1976,[183][186] but the city did not become a major centre of learning until the second half of the 1990s. At that time, the public Kigali Health Institute (KHI), Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) were founded, along with private universities the Kigali Independent University (ULK) and the University of Lay Adventists of Kigali (UNILAK).In 2018 Kigali had 239 primary schools with 203,680 pupils enrolled,[195] and 143 secondary schools with an enrolment of 60,997.[196] The large rate of drop-out between primary and secondary, a phenomenon which occurs across Rwanda, is attributed by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF to insufficient numeracy and English skills in primary-school finishers, cost, the need for children to contribute to household labour, and insufficient teaching resources.[197] The city's three districts occupied the top positions in the national table of exam results at primary level in 2019, although this success was not replicated at secondary level in which rural districts were the top performers.

                Kigali is a province-level city, one of the five provinces of Rwanda. The area under the city's jurisdiction has been expanded several times since Rwandan independence,[106] the current boundaries being established through a 2005 law as part of local-government restructuring. The law gave the city government responsibility for strategic planning and urban development, as well as liaising with the three constituent districts and monitoring the districts' development plans.[140] Like other provinces, Kigali is divided into districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which are in turn divided into 35 sectors.[1]

From January 2020 a new administrative system for Kigali was introduced, after a law was passed by the national parliament the previous year.[141] Under the previous system, in effect since 2002, power was significantly devolved to the districts which were led by their own mayors, managing infrastructure and levying taxes, around 30 per cent of which were passed to the city-wide authority.[142] The changes, implemented with the goal of reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency,[141] gave the city council much greater power including control of the budget.[143] The districts ceased to be separate legal entities, their mayors being replaced by district executive administrators appointed by the national government.[

                <h2> What To Know</h2>
                <p> Kigali is a vibrant, modern, clean, and exciting city. Unlike some African cities, Kigali feels very safe to walk around, even at night, which makes it a perfect introduction to visiting Africa and is why it’s sometimes referred to as “Africa for beginners.” </p>

                <h2> When To Go </h2>
                <p>Like many parts of Africa, Rwanda has wet and dry seasons, so if you want to avoid the rains, the best time to visit is in the long dry season that runs from June to mid-September. This is especially a great time for those looking to go trekking to avoid the treacherous and muddy terrain.</p>

                <h2> What To Eat </h2>
                <p> The most famous local food in Kigali is the brochette, which is a shish kebab with either meat or fish. Many restaurants serve them in the city, however, if you want yours as authentic as possible, head to one of the many local bars and wash them down with a cold Primus beer. Other popular local dishes include ugali, a maize porridge that is the staple in many African countries, along with nyama choma, which is barbecued meat often served with kachumbari, a salad made with tomato, onion, and chilli. Finally, don't leave Kigali without trying akabenz, a tasty barbecued pork dish. </p>
