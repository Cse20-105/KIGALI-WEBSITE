                <p>Five years ago, the country’s government went on an initiative to promote home-grown talent and products abroad, launching the Made in Rwanda campaign. The result has seen a 69% increase in exports, and the fashion industry has boomed. It’s also inspired a new generation of young designers who are keen to put Rwanda, and specifically Kigali, on the map. “The Made in Rwanda concept has, without doubt, increased the number of young people interested in establishing their dreams in the fashion industry,” says John Bunyeshuli, founder and director of Kigali Fashion Week. “I’ve always said we want to have Kigali as the fashion hub of Africa – in other words, the ‘Paris of Africa’ – and our government is injecting a lot of funding into the creative industries. Designers are all benefiting from that support.”As the local fashion community has grown, so too has the number of annual fashion events. Kigali Fashion Week was one of the first when it launched 10 years ago, but is joined by others including the Rwanda Cultural Fashion Show and Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, which held its inaugural edition in Kigali in 2019.</p>

        <p> In September, we flew into the capital city of Kigali before heading out to the Virunga Mountains to see mountain gorillas. Instantly, it was apparent how much rebuilding and growth has occurred since the Rwandan genocide of 1994, when 800,000 men, women, and children were massacred, one of the most horrific atrocities in human history.Finding trash or litter in Kigali is a challenge; this booming metropolis of 11.5 million people is incredibly clean. And by any standards, Kigali is safe. Oddly, however, it's rare to spot any pets. Even feral cats and stray dogs are few and far between.
            Instead of dogs on the other end of leashes, there are goats, at least in the countryside. Children take their goats for walks. The animals have names. They have value. And though the goats don't sleep indoors (happily), they're well cared for, one might even say, loved.It turns out that cats have never been a part of Rwandan culture. I asked around, but no one seemed to know why. It's not that cats are poorly thought of; they just haven't been considered until recently. As Americans and Europeans influence culture, particularly in the big city like Kigali, there's an increasing interest in "getting a cat."High in the mountains, near the lush forest homes of the mountain gorillas, we stayed at the Virunga Lodge, where Puss the cat lives. Overall, Puss has a darn good life. There's no shortage of love, food or entertainment. Tourists (like me), missing their own cats, can ask for handouts from the kitchen and snuggle with Puss, who clearly enjoys the attention. Kitchen staff offer up whatever Puss wants, and there are lots of lizards and birds around for variety.Still, I can't imagine there's much veterinary care in the Rwandan countryside should Puss become sick or injured. In many countries, veterinary care and commercial pet food remain luxuries few can afford. </p>
